<h3 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h3>
<p>Our services are provided “as is” and you make use of these services at your own risk. It would be very foolish of you to rely on our service in a way that could cause you any loss or damage. Do not do so. In particular you should be aware of the following disclaimers:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>While we make all reasonable efforts to ensure that our services are continuously available, service interruptions for reasons beyond our control are inevitable. <em>We will accept no liability for any loss you suffer as a result of any interruption to or unavailability or suspension of our services however caused</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, it is virtually impossible to eliminate all bugs from software, however well written. For this reason it is inevitable that our system will occasionally fail to work as expected even if it gives every sign of having done so. <em>We therefore accept no liability for any loss you may suffer as a result of any failure by the site to perform or to have performed in the manner expected of it</em>. You should not rely on the site having worked — for example that it has successfully sent an email —. If you need that level of reliability you should investigate a commercial service.</p></li>
<li><p>Information posted by users to the site — for example in forums or as comments — is beyond our control and we accept no liability for it whatsoever. Even though we make reasonable efforts to ensure that information that we put on the site is accurate, we draw much of our material from third parties and cannot guarantee its accuracy. You therefore agree that <em>we are not liable for any errors in information we supply on the site.</em></p></li>
<li><p>It should go without saying that you take responsibility for anything that you write on the site, or the content of any emails that you send using it. While may provide templated information to assit you in writing an email, you should always check that you are happy for it to be sent under your name. Any information you contribute to the site will be visible to the entire world, and any email you send through it may be published by its recipient. People’s reputations have suffered because of poorly thought out emails and contributions to web sites. Only you can make sure that doesn’t happen to you. You agree that <em>we are not responsible for the contents of any email you send, or any material you cause to be displayed on the site.</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In no event shall we be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages however caused and arising in anyway out of the use of our services or software.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>You consent to our storing and processing the personal information that you have supplied about yourself in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 id="suspension-and-termination">Suspension and Termination</h3>
<p>Either party may terminate this contract at any time by giving written notice to the other. No reason need be given for termination.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to do any of the following without being required to give you any reason or notice:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the functionality of this site</p></li>
<li><p>block access to this site from any part of the internet or by any particular means</p></li>
<li><p>implement a repeat infringer’s policy pursuant to the USC 512(i) or any similar provision</p></li>

<p>The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 does not apply to this agreement.</p>
